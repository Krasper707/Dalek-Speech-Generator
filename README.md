# Dalek Speech Generator

A Python-based Dalek speech generator that transforms input sentences into Dalek-style speech. The project will use GPT-2, Transformers, LangChain, and text-to-speech synthesis (pyttsx3/ElevenLabs API) to generate and vocalize Dalek-like responses.

## Current Status 🚀

- ✅ Uploaded initial dataset (JSON) for training/testing.
- ❌ Model implementation in progress.
- ❌ Voice synthesis to be added.
- ❌ Chatbot mode planned.

## Dataset 📂

The dataset consists of structured dialogues, phrases, and speech patterns inspired by the Daleks from Doctor Who. It will be used to fine-tune the language model for Dalek-style text generation.

## Upcoming Features 🛠️

- Text-to-Dalek speech conversion using GPT-2 or fine-tuned transformers.

- Voice synthesis using pyttsx3 or ElevenLabs API.

- Interactive chatbot mode for real-time conversations.

## Getting Started 🏁

For now, you can explore the dataset in the data/ folder. Once the model is implemented, installation steps and usage instructions will be added.
